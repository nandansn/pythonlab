Shallow-Copy-And-Deep-Copy:
--------------------------
copy function:
    because of copy function new object will be created, this is called cloning.

    

shallow copy:
    if the original object contains reference to the mutable object(like list), 
    just duplicate reference variables will be created, pointing to old contained object.

    example : [1,2,3,[7,8,9],4,5,6]
    for [7,8,9] reference will be created.

    import copy - > module
    object2 = copy.copy(object1)

    
deep copy:

    copy.deepcopy()
    created new object for muted reference in the contained object

Usage:
    if the original object does not contain any nested mutable object go for shallow copy, otherwise go for deepcopy.
