Instance variable:
    value of the variable, vary from object to object.
    For every object seperate copy of instance variable will be created.
    Inside constructor we will use 'self' to declare/define the variables.
    We can declare instance variable in instance methods also.
    Instance variable decalred inside the method will be available, after calling that instnace method
    outside the class you can declare instance variable for that instance.

    To access instance variable,
        inside class we can use 'self' to access the instance variable,
        outside the class we can use reference variable.
