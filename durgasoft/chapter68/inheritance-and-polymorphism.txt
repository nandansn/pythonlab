Inheritance and Polymorphism

How we can use memebers of one class inside another class?
    1. By using composition
        Has-A-Relationship
    2. By using Inheritance
        Is-A-Relationship

By using composition:

class car has a engine reference.
Advantage is code re-usability.

class Car

e = Engine()

class Engine


By using inheritance:
    variables
    methods
    contructors
    all above available to child class

contructor:
    if child class contains contructor, child class constructor only executed.
    if child class contains destructor, child class destructor only executed.
    if child class contains instance/class/static method, child class insance/class/static method only executed. instance/static/class methods with same name.

super():
    using super(), we can explicitly call instance/class/static methods of parent class.
    using super(), we can explicitly call static variable
    We can't access parent class instance varaibles using super()


parent class contructor/memebers by default available to the child.
