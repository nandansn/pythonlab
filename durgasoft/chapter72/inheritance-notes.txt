Inheritance:
1. single Inheritance
    class P:
        pass
    class C(P):
        pass

2. multilevel Inheritance
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    class C(B): pass

3. hierarchical:
    class A: pass
    class B(A): pass
    class C(A): pass

4. multiple heritance

    class P: pass
    Class Q; pass
    class C(P,Q): pass

    In pyhton method resolution happens based on the order we define for multiple intheritance.
    
5. Hybrid:
    Combination of Single, multilevel and hierarchical.
