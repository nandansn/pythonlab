Abstract class:
    class partially implemented.
    when you inherit from ABC and the abstract class contains atleast one abstract method then you can't instantiate the class
    abstract class can contain both abstract and normal methods
    child classes are responsible to provide implementation of parent class abstract method 

    code example:
    from abc import *
    class Vehicle(ABC): # ABC -> Abstract Base Class, ABC is not mandatory.
        @abstractmethod
        def getWheels(self):
            pass
