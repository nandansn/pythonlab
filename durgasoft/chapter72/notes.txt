super():
    using super we can access parent class, class variable.
    using super we can access parent class, instance methods.
    using super we can access parent class, class methods.
    using super we can access parent class, static methods.
    instance variable can be accessed using self keyword of the child classs

Inside class:
    1. we can use super in side instance method of child class.
        1. instance method: no restriction to use super()
        2. constructor method: no restriction to use super()
    2. class method: 
        from class method we cant call parent class constructos using super()
        from class method we cant call parent class instance method using super()
        from class method, we can access static variable, static method and class method using super()
    3. static method:
           we cant access static variable using super()
           we cant access parent class constructor using super()
           we cant access parent class instance method using super()
           we cant access parent class class method using super()
           we cant access parent class  static method using super()
           static is general utility method, no way related to class or instance. super() is not applicable inside static method
