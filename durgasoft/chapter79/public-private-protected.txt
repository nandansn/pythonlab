public, private, protected:
--------------------------
public:
    by default all variables in python are public in a class, x = 10
private:    
    to declare a variable as private, need to use, __x = 10
    private variables, within the class only
protected:
    protected is not implemented in python,
    just for conventional thing we use like, _x=10, means, this is protected, we can use in child class.

Note:
    we can access the private variable in directly in python.
