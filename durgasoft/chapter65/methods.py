1. instance methods:
    object related methods,
    inside method body, if the logic uses the instance variables, then its good to declare it as instance method.
    method(self) -> automatically, becomes instance method.

    getter and setter methods:
    getter - to access values or accessor method.
    setter - to set/modify values, change values, mutator method.

2. class methods:
    if you are using only class level variable or static variable in a method, then use the method as class method

3. static method:
    if you are not using class or instnace variable, do some calculation or computation withh or without variable, then we can use static methods
