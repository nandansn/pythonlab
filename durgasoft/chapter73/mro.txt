MRO Rules:
1. first priority for child class methods,
2. if child class does not contain methods, then look for parent class methods,
3. If there are multiple parent, order of searching will be left to right.
4. MRO, python will visit any class only once.

Linearizarion.
L(c) = c + merge (L(P1),L(P2),,,ParentList)

If the object present in head part only, not in tail part of any list remove it and add.

L(C) = C + merge(L(P1) , L(P2), P1P2)
        C + Merge (P1O, P2O, P1P2)
        C + P1 + Merge(O, P2O, P2)

        C + P1 + P2 Merge(O,O)

        C + P1 + P2 + O
