# When our program grows bigger, it is a good idea to break it into different modules.

#A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Python modules have a filename and end with the extension .py.

#Definitions inside a module can be imported to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python.
#  We use the import keyword to do this.

import math

print("pi value is %3.2f" %math.pi)
