# While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

# Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned.
# Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.

# We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.


#example

x = lambda x:x*2 #Here x is the argument and x * 2 is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.

print(x(5));
