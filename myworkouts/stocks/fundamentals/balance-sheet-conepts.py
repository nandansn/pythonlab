        Current liabilities are a company's short-term financial obligations that are due within one year
        or within a normal operating cycle. An operating cycle is the time it takes a company to purchase 
        inventory and convert it to cash from sales. Current liabilities are the result of a company's operating 
        activities or day-to-day business operations.
